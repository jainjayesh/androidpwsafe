    Password Safe is a password database utility. Users can keep their passwords securely encrypted on their computers. A single Safe Combination unlocks them all.\n\nPassword Safe protects passwords with the Twofish encryption algorithm, a fast, free alternative to DES. The program\'s security has been thoroughly verified by Counterpane Labs under the supervision of Bruce Schneier, author of Applied Cryptography and creator of the Twofish algorithm.\n
